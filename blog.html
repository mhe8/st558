  <h3>What do you think being a data scientist is about? </h3>
    <p>
      Data scientists handle large data set, to use proficient software engineer’s skills to manipulate the data, in order to extract the knowledge from the data. With the network of the knowledge discovered from data and the common sense, data scientists develop the predictive models to simulate the reality, which is the way of our real world scientists providing the predictions that will happen in the future.
      The way of developing models can be traditional statistical methodologies or machine learning methodologies. Both ways work and can be benchmarks to each other.
    </p>
  <h3>What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas? </h3>
    <p>The major duty is using data to speak about the “truth of the world”. The main goal is to develop accurate model for prediction.
    Thus the knowledge domain of data scientists will not be limited only with software developing but with solid statistical knowledge base.
    </p>
  <h3>What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?</h3>

    <p>Data scientists need to have stronger programming skills like R, Python, SAS, Spark to manipulate data sets, and also Hadoop, SQL kind of tools to store the data sets.
    Data scientists need to implement the machine learning model, tune model, but not necessary to develop all the algorithms like the statisticians.

    Statisticians may more focus on the inference, mathematical perspective, with more strong and comprehensive on different statistical knowledge.
    </p>
  <h3>How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?</h3>
  <p>My goal is to be a good data scientist, now I have a full time job of Quantitative model developer, which is also related to data science, so I need to enhance my skills as well as the statistical knowledge base.
